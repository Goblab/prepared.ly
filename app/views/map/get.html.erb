<h2><strong>Last Summer, over 1300 homes were destroyed in Bastrop County due to wildfire.</strong><br>
We don’t want that to happen to you. We’ve developed an easy-to-use application that brings 
together a variety of checklists and fire tools, and gives them to you in a manageable, timely, 
and actionable form.
</h2>

<!--</br></br>
We’re piloting the application in Austin, Texas.
You’ll find a survey attached on the next page, please fill it out and we’ll use the information you give us to make it work better. You can fill it out online at www.prepared.ly/survey, or by hand and return it to your block captain. We appreciate your time and your input helps us develop a tool that will work for you. 
</br></br>
Prepared.ly is a project by Code for Ameria for the City of Austin and Travis County. 
Austin is one of 8 cities participating in the 2013 city program, and the Code for America 
Austin Team is collaborating with the Austin Fire Department, and the City of Austin to create 
Prepared.ly, a tool to help homeowners be more prepared for wildfires.
