                <li>
                <h1>Don’t set anything on fire, seriously.</h1>
                <p> If you smoke, don’t throw cigarette butts out the window or into the trash still lit. 
                No BBQing - we suggest just going to Franklin’s, instead. 
                Remember, there's always a burn ban within Austin city limits.

                    <h1>Clear dry and/or flammable materials away from your house.</h1>
                <p>Do a quick walk around your house, and keep an eye out for brush, dry leaves, or dead branches and make sure to move them away from your house. 
                If you’re feeling friendly, do it for your neighbor’s house, too!</p>

                    <h1>If you see something on fire, call it in. </h1>
                <p>Don’t assume someone has already reported a fire if you see one &mdash; the fire department doesn’t mind getting lots of calls about one fire, but they can’t put it out if they don’t know about it.
